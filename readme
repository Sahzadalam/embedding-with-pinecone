<!-- To store embedding there is two ways :
    api:- 1. /embed?type=userInput {provide text in body like {text:something}}
          2. /embed?type=test {to store the prestored csv text embedding}

     - first is you can store the embedding by providing comma separated text by the api (example:- Dog is a animal,Cats are cute,etc)

     - second way is you can just call the api and there is prestore csv file in the backend repo it will auto store the embedding by taking text from there


To search through embedding from api :
     api:- /search?q=Cats -->
